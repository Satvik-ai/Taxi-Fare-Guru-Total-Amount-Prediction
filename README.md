## Taxi Fare Guru : Total Amount Prediction

### Data Science, Predictive Analytics, Python(Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborne)

• Overview : Developed predictive models to estimate the total amount paid by travelers for taxi rides.

• Process : Loaded the datasets into dataframe and performed exploratory data analysis to visualize key
statistics and identity relationships among the features & data type of the features. Then performed data
preprocessing like separating the features & label, data cleaning, feature encoding & scaling, transformation. After
that, trained multiple models like linear regression, polynomial regression, knn regression, random forest regressor
etc. with the aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of total fare amount predictions for taxi rides and
performed hyperparameter tuning to improve the model. Models were evaluated using R2 score.
